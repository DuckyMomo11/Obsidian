# Journal
Just an ordinary, boring day again. Nothing notable really happened other than work. I've been staying consistent with my routines though. I tried using more cologne this time and I was really happy with the how it smelled. Yesterday I only did a few sprays, on my wrists then on my neck, but i tried adding the inside of my elbows this time and actually holding the spray down instead of doing a half spray. I'm pretty sure that's what you're supposed to do, but I'm still new to this so we'll see how it goes. It does make my neck burn a little though, specifically on the left side. I don't know if it's because of how I'm doing my skincare but I need to monitor how that goes. 

I closed with Alex today at women's and we were talking about K-pop a little bit. Miguel apparently doesn't really listen to Twice anymore, and instead is listening to BTS more, which I find funny since I was the opposite before. Bro is really just trying to copy me LOL. I got an e-mail on the way home that my glasses are ready for pickup, so I need to go get them tomorrow.
