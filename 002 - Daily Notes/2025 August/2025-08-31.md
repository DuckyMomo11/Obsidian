# Journal
We went to church this morning. 9 am Mass again. Mom couldn't come with us because her gout was acting up, probably because of Chelsea's and Baby's pasulobong. We lit a candle for Nanay for her since she couldn't come with us, and we prayed for her for a little bit. I drove us this time, but it was just with Marvin and Dad. After getting home, I literally did nothing. I tried Overwatch again, but it honestly just isn't that fun anymore. I ended up really just laying down and watching some Twice videos again.  I did stumble on a few Stray Kidz videos too and goddamn Felix's voice is so nice to listen to. LOL.

Brooke kept on asking me to swap shifts, but Baby wasn't answering me at all, so I just didn't switch at all. Now she's gonna come with me at 11 even though she starts at 3. She just doesn't want to drive at all, but it's up to her.
