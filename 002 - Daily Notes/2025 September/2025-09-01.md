# Journal
I finally got to take the car again LOL. I picked up Baby even though she started at 3, but I started at 11, so I just dropped her off at Marshall's while I went to work. She came into work with a bag of stuff she bought, so maybe it wasn't the smartest thing to do. Closing went fine, it was really busy but at least I got to close Men's for the first time in a while. I'm assuming that's not gonna happen again for a long time. My close looked absolutely beautiful if I do say so myself.

When I got home, Baby and I played some games on Discord. We started with Catan, which I won, then we moved on to a quiz game where I really tried to win but I'm just stupid. Then we played a little bit of pool before we said goodnight. 

I'm getting more and more obsessed with K-pop every day, and today just happens to be a Stray Kids day. I'm obsessed with God's Menu, it just sounds so good (especially Felix). I'm gonna try some more songs tomorrow, and maybe add a few to my playlist. We're going to U of M tomorrow, so it's the perfect time to listen to some music. We're getting Korean BBQ as well, so I'm just gonna have a light snack for "lunch".
