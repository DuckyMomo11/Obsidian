# Journal
First day back in school, we went with Marvin to the Seel Station Park and Ride. We meant to go to the Clarence Station, but I accidentally went to the Seel Station. It was a lot more empty than I thought it would be, so I think we're just gonna commit to that one instead. When we got to school, Baby had a class, so I just sat at one of the tables by the Tim Hortons in Engineering until Carl and Viann saw me and said hi. I felt a little uncomfortable with Viann, just because of the thing that happened with Jullana, but oh well. I put all of my syllabus onto Obsidian and found the textbooks I needed off of libgen. None of my classes required a physical copy, so this works just fine for me.

I joined the MATH 2080 class even though I'm on the waitlist for the section. I decided to at least attend the lectures so I don't get behind if I'm able to get in.
