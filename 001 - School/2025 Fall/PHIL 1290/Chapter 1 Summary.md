>What is an Argument? By definition it is a conclusion that is supported by premises. Fundamentally, it is defending some claim. It is important for us to analyze these claims, and dispute them, not just blindly accept what we are told.
## To Identify an Argument
Ask yourself two questions:
1. Is the point disputable in the context?
2. Are there reasons given as to why one should accept that point?
If yes to both, we have an argument!

Sometimes a piece of text can satisfy both requirements to be an argument or an explanation or even neither

**Simple Argument** Conclusion supported by 1 or more premises

**Complex Argument** Conclusion supported by 1 or more premises, at least one of which is itself defended by premises
	-> Called sub-conclusion or sub-argument

*Ceteris Paribis* All things being equal
- The simplest explanation is more likely to be true
- With more premises, the likelihood for a claim to be true gets lower
	-> Only needing 1 thing to be true, is more likely than needing 2 things to be true, and so on.
