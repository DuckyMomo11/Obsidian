## What is an Argument?
>> *Argument* A speech act intended to persuade an audience to accept a statement that is disputed in the context (conclusion) through reasons/evidence (premises) that demonstrate the truth of the conclusion

- Not the same as a quarrel
- The purpose is to persuade

*A conclusion supported by premises*

*Indicator Words* can help locate premises and conclusions
-> See Chapter 1 Pre-Lecture Notes for example
- Not all arguments include indicator words
- Not all phrases with indicator words are arguments

Premise -----> Conclusion
-> The in between is called an inference
#### Inductive vs Deductive Inference

>> *Explanation* A set of statements (explanans) showing how it came to be that a fact (explanandum) is the way it is (usually in a casual sense)

> ! Explanans can be mistaken for premises and an explanandum fora conclusion. Make sure to take context into account

#### Identifying Arguments
Ask yourself 2 questions:
1. Is the point disputable in the context?
2. are there reasons given as to why one should accept that point?
	
If yes to both, then it's an argument
