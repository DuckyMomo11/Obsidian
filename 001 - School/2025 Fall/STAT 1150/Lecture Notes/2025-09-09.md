## Data Distribution
The `distribution` of a data set tells us what values a variable takes and how often it takes these values

#### Bar Chart 
- Displays categorical variable values on one axis and frequencies on the other

> Note: There are spaces between bar as not to imply continuity

#### Pie Chart
- Gives us a visual representation of the relative frequency of the observed values for a categorical variable

#### Frequency Distribution
- Displays how frequently each variable appears in a chart format
ex.

| Score | Frequency |
| ----- | --------- |
| 0-10  | 2         |
| 10-20 | 3         |
| 20-30 | 5         |
| 30-40 | 7         |
| 40-50 | 4         |
