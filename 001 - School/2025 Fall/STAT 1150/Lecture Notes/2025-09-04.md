## Unit 1 - Examining Distributions

## Simple Definitions
`Statistics` The set of methods for obtaining, organizing, summarizing, presenting and analyzing data

`Data` Characteristics measured on individuals or units 
	-> i.e. people, animals, places, things, etc.

`Population` A collection of all individuals we want information from

`Sample` A subset of the population
	-> Easier to work with samples instead of a full population

`Variable` A Characteristic or property of an individual

## Data 
There are 2 types of data:
- `Quantitative Data` Numerical data where it makes sense to perform arithmetic
- `Categorical Data` Data that can be sorted into categories
	-> If it makes sense to sort, we call it `Categorical and Ordinal`
	-> If it does NOT make sense to sort, we call it `Categorical and Nominal`
