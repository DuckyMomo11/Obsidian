# Important Definitions
$A \subset R$ is *bounded above* if there is $b \in R$ such that $a \leq b$ for $a \in A$
$A \subset R$ is *bounded below* if there is $c \in R$ such that $a \geq c$ for $a \in A$

$s \in R$ is the *supremum* or *least upper bound* of $A$ if:
1. $s$ is an upper bound of $A$
2. For any upper bound $b$, $b \geq s$
- Written as $s = sup(A)$
