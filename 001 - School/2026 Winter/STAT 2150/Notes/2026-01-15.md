# R Basics
*R* code can be comprised of a variety of things, such as functions, calculations and plots

> Always create your code in an *R* Script File (.R file)

> Comment your code using # to allow others to know what you are doing

When something is created in *R*, it is an object
- These are divided by classes
	- String
	- Numeric
	- Logical
	- Matrix
	- Data Frame
	- Lists
	- etc.

*Vector* - consists of a sequence of *components* which are of the same class

```{r}
vector <- c(x1,x2,...,xn)
```

*Matrix* - a generalization of a vector in that it contains many elements of the same type but they are arranged in *rows* and *columns*
-> A vector is a special case of a matrix that either has 1 row or 1 column

```{r}
matrix <- matrix(c(x11,...,xmn), nrow = m, ncol = n, byrow = True)
```

*List* - an *R* structure which contain objects of *different* types and even lengths

```{r}
list <- list()
list[[1]] <- object1
list[[2]] <- object2
```

*Data Frame* - a two-dimensional array-like structure which is separated into columns each of equal length
-> Each column is typically associated with a variable and the data on the variables can be of different forms

# Built-in Functions

>NOTE: If you use ? before a function name, you can be directed to the documentation for the function

`class()` - determines an objects class type

`print()` - enters some text into the terminal

`length()` - returns the size of a vector

`dim()` - returns the dimensions of an object

`which()` - returns the index where some expression holds

`t()` - transposes a matrix

`rep()` - repeats some action

`cbind()` - combines a vector to a matrix as a column

`rbind()` - combines a vector to a matrix as a row

`rm()` - removes an object

`sqrt()` - returns square root of some number

`log(value, base = exp(1))` - returns the logarithm for some number
-> exp(1) is the natural log, changing the value to ~2.718 allows us to find the base 10 logarithm

`sum()` - returns the sum of all objects in a vector

`mean()` - returns the average value of a vector

`median()` - returns the median value of a vector

`min()` - returns the smallest value of a vector

`max()` - returns the biggest value of a vector

`seq()`

`round(value, digits = 0)` - rounds the value to the nearest full value given
-> digits gives us the amount of digits we want after the decimal point

`sort()` - returns a vector with all objects organized from least to greatest

`order()` - returns the same vector as sort(), but with the indexes from the original matrix

# Libraries and Packages
*Package* - a collection of functions with some connecting theme
-> stored in libraries

```{r}
install.packages("name") # allows us to install some package
library(name) # loads the libary into r so we can use it
```
