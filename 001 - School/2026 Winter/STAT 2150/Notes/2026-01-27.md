# Unit 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is the first key step in analyzing the data and can be considered an initial investigation of a data set

EDA can entail:
1. Visualizing data and discovering patterns and structures
2. Identifying abnormalities and outliers
3. Identifying important variables/optimal factor settings
4. Checking assumptions

Tools used in EDA depend on the type of the data
- Categorical (Qualitative) Data
	- Graphical Summaries:Pie and Bar Charts
	- Numerical Summaries:Counts, Frequency Tables, Cross Tabulations
- Numerical (Quantitative) Data
	- Graphical Summaries: Histogram, Boxplot, Comparative Plots
	- Numerical Summaries: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation, Quartiles, etc.
- Bivariate Numerical Data
	- Graphical Summaries: Scatterplot
	- Numerical Summaries: Correlation
- Time Series Data
	- Graphical Summaries: Time Series Plot
	- Numerical Summaries: Auto-Correlation
- High-Dimensional and Complex Data
