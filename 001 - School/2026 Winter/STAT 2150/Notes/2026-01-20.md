# Reading Data
One of the main uses of *R* is *data analysis*
-> Exploratory data analysis will be the focus of Unit 2

`data()` - returns the list of built-in data sets

`summary(df)` - provides a summary of a particular data frame


### Importing .csv files
You may also import data from the internet as a `.csv` file

`df <- read.csv(file = "path/to/file", header = TRUE)`
-> `header = TRUE` tells *R* that the top row has column names

### Importing a Data Set from a Website
Suppose a website contains a data set you would like to import into *R*
-> The simplest method to do this is to use the function `read.table`

```{r}
web.data <- read.table(url("https://www.example.com"))
```

### Entering Data Manually
-- do after


### Augmenting a Data Frame
-- do after
- similar to cbind()


### Saving *R* Objects
Sometimes, you have an object that can take hours to create
-> we don't want to have to recreate it

We can save the object to a location that can be called at a later time

```{r}
save(data, file = "path")
load("path")
```

### Saving .jpg or .pdf File
-- do after


# Writing Functions
An *R* function is an object containing instructions for a particular purpose and can be reused
-> it typically has 4 main pieces:
1. Name
2. Arguments - inputs to the function
3. Body - does the work of the function
4. Output - what is returned once the function is executed

- Arguments of functions can be assigned *default* values
	-> If you do not specify a value for an argument, it will use the default values

```{r}
example <- function(arguments) {
	# does something
}

example(x) # calls the function
```

> You may call functions within a function
