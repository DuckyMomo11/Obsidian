# Reading Data
One of the main uses of *R* is *data analysis*
-> Exploratory data analysis will be the focus of Unit 2

`data()` - returns the list of built-in data sets

`summary(df)` - provides a summary of a particular data frame


### Importing .csv files
You may also import data from the internet as a `.csv` file

`df <- read.csv(file = "path/to/file", header = TRUE)`
-> `header = TRUE` tells *R* that the top row has column names

### Importing a Data Set from a Website
Suppose a website contains a data set you would like to import into *R*
-> The simplest method to do this is to use the function `read.table`

```{r}
web.data <- read.table(url("https://www.example.com"))
```

### Entering Data Manually

### Augmenting a Data Frame
-- do after
- similar to cbind()


### Saving *R* Objects
Sometimes, you have an object that can take hours to create
-> we don't want to have to recreate it

We can save the object to a location that can be called at a later time

```{r}
save(data, file = "path")
load("path")
```

### Saving .jpg or .pdf File
-- do after


# Writing Functions
An *R* function is an object containing instructions for a particular purpose and can be reused
-> it typically has 4 main pieces:
1. Name
2. Arguments - inputs to the function
3. Body - does the work of the function
4. Output - what is returned once the function is executed

- Arguments of functions can be assigned *default* values
	-> If you do not specify a value for an argument, it will use the default values

```{r}
example <- function(arguments) {
	# does something
}

example(x) # calls the function
```

> You may call functions within a function

# Logical Operators
### Standard Logical Operators:
& - and
| - or
! - not
< - less than
> - greater than
-> fix this

<= - less than or equal to
>= - greater than or equal to
-> fix this

== - equal to
!= - not equal to

# Conditionals
Conditionals are expressions which tell *R* to compute something depending on whether a condition is satisfied or not

```{r}
if(condition) {
	# does something
}
elseif(condition) {
	# does something if above is false
}
else {
	# does something if all above is false
}
```

# Loops
Loops are a way to *automate* repetition of steps/calculations
### For Loop
A sequence is supplied and the statement/function is evaluated/executed on each item in the sequence
-> The loop is exited once the last item is reached

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
	# does something 10 times
}
```

### While Loop
The loop is only entered if some *condition* is satisfied
- Once executed, the condition needs to be *re-evaluated* and once the condition is no longer satisfied, the loop is exited

```{r}
while(condition) {
	# Does something as long as condition is true
}
```
