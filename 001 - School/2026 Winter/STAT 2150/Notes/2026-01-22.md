# Logical Operators
### Standard Logical Operators:
& - and
| - or
! - not
< - less than
> - greater than
-> fix this

<= - less than or equal to
>= - greater than or equal to
-> fix this

== - equal to
!= - not equal to

> If you use a data frame or vector, the condition will go through each element and return True or False

```{r}
df[which(df == 1),] # returns rows of data frame where expression holds
df[df == 1,] # you don't need to use which to do this
```

Suppose you wanted to subset the above further

Method 1: Store the subsetted data frame, then subset that one

Method 2:
```{r}
df[df$example == 1,] # Returns the elements where the condition holds in some column
```
# Conditionals
Conditionals are expressions which tell *R* to compute something depending on whether a condition is satisfied or not

```{r}
if(condition) {
	# does something if condition is true
} else if(condition) {
	# does something if above is false, and condition is true
} else { # else must be on the same line as the closing bracket or R won't see it as if - else
	# does something if all above is false
}
```

*R* also has a built in function called `ifelse`
```{r}
ifelse(condition, output if condition is true, output if condition is false)
# Ex:
ifelse(x < 2, 2, 3)
```

Example from class:
```{r}
# Write a function that prints the min and max elements of a matrix 
# and reports if the max is larger than 100

minmax <- function(A) {
  minele <- min(A)
  maxele <- max(A)
  y = c(minele, maxele)
  print(y)
  if (maxele > 100) {
    print("Maximum element is larger than 100")
  } else {
    print("Maximum element is less than 100")
  }
}

A <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)

minmax(A)

```
# Loops
Loops are a way to *automate* repetition of steps/calculations
### For Loop
A sequence is supplied and the statement/function is evaluated/executed on each item in the sequence
-> The loop is exited once the last item is reached

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
	# does something 10 times
}
```

### While Loop
The loop is only entered if some *condition* is satisfied
- Once executed, the condition needs to be *re-evaluated* and once the condition is no longer satisfied, the loop is exited

```{r}
while(condition) {
	# Does something as long as condition is true
}
```
